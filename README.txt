1. Firstly, navigate to your XAMPP and put the foodsmith folder into htdocs.
2. After that, start your xampp and navigate to phpmyadmin
3. Create a new database called "poscafe". Should your phpmyadmin has username or password, go to connection/connection.php to change the configuration.
4. In newly created database poscafe, import the poscafev2.sql in the connection folder into the database.
5. To log in, navigate to http://localhost/FoodSmith-Cafe-POS-System/cms/ (Username: teradon Password: 12345)
6. After logging in, you will be redirected to the CMS homepage. To navigate to the menu or waiter front end, go to http://localhost/FoodSmith-Cafe-POS-System/.
7. To enter back into the CMS, navigate to http://localhost/FoodSmith-Cafe-POS-System/cms/

*Pls make sure the root folder is http://localhost/FoodSmith-Cafe-POS-System/ not http://localhost/FoodSmith-Cafe-POS-System/FoodSmith-Cafe-POS-System/
as when extracted it will create another folder with the actual folder inside it.
